### Notes on Java
- Java is a procedural as well as an object-oriented language.
- It's a statically typed language.

- Every file name ending with extension ".java" is a class itself.
- Class names should start with capital letters. Though you can also start with small letters, it's not considered a good practice.
- each line has to end with a semi-colon
- The public class name should be the same name as the file name.
- java. lang packages are by default imported in the java class by the JVM
- One can use wrapper classes like Integer instead of primitive datatypes like int to add more functionality to the variables.
- Java supports unicode values meaning that it can support any language in the world.
- "==" is used to compare the values of two variables. It is used to compare the reference of two objects. To compare the values of two objects, we use the `equals()` method. Like `str1.equals(str2)`.
- Any function inside a static function also has to be static. Basically, a static function can only call other static functions. And even variables inside a static function have to be static.
- Primitive datatypes are stored in the stack while objects are stored in the heap.
- Primitive datatypes are passed by value while objects are passed by reference.
- References in Java abstract memory management, providing safety and simplicity by preventing common memory-related issues.
- Java abstracts away memory management. You create objects using the new keyword, and Java's garbage collector automatically reclaims memory when objects are no longer reachable.
- A reference points to an object in memory, but you don't directly manipulate memory addresses like in C.
- Shadowing is when a variable in a local scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. The local variable shadows the outer variable.
- Variable Arguments (varargs) are a feature that allows you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a method. Denoted by three dots (...), varargs are used when you don't know how many arguments will be passed to a method, or if you don't want to create a separate parameter for each argument.
- varargs should be the last parameter in a method's parameter list.
- Some packages that you need to import are:
  - `Scanner` class from `java.util` package
